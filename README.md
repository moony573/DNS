# Task 6: DNS Spoofing Attack Simulation — Expanded Professional Report

## Overview
This repository contains a detailed professional report and practical simulation of a DNS Spoofing attack in a controlled lab environment. The project demonstrates the step-by-step methodology, tools, configurations, and observations necessary to understand DNS Spoofing attacks while emphasizing ethical practices and legal compliance.

The purpose of this project is to provide hands-on exposure to DNS attack vectors, enable forensic packet analysis, and highlight defensive measures for cybersecurity practitioners.
